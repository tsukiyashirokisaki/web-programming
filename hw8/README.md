## Homework Requirements

0. Click on this [link](https://classroom.github.com/a/kTpXaAsP) to access the reference code from GitHub classroom.
```
https://classroom.github.com/a/kTpXaAsP
```

1. Change directory to "own"
```
cd own
```

2. Copy files from HW#6 or HW#7 here. You are advised to write HW#8 on top of them.

3. Change the APIs from RESTful to GraphQL. That is, you are advised to use graphQL-yoga and React-Apollo for backend and frontend services. Besides, for chatting app purpose, you should still use WebSocket instead of simple HTTP requests.

4. Change the frontend (i.e. the chat window) so that:
- When the chat window starts, you can specify who you are in an input box.
- Two users on different windows can chat to each other 
- For each message, you should specify who you want to talk to and then enter the chat message (similar to HW#6)
- Each window with a specific user should subscribe to any incoming message addressed to this user. That is, if someone sends you a message from another window, your subscription should detect that mutation on DB and that message should appear automatically on your window.
- (Optional. This is difficult) Implement the "Clear" button -- that is, when it is pressed, all the message sent by and addressed to this user should be deleted/removed from the database as well as other users' windows.

5. Start the server and client on ports 4000 and 3000, respectively.

6. Use "dotenv-defaults" and make sure ".env" is in .gitignore so that your MONGO_URL won't be revealed.
